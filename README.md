# USC SLICE Project

The SLICE (Student-Led In-CAVE Exploration) project at USC (University of the Sunshine Coast) is aimed at developing new teaching software for our CAVE2 environment (a 320-degree circular CAVE with an 84 mega-pixel display).  The two main goals of the SLICE project are:

1. To improve student engagement by providing tools that allow multiple users to explore and interact with different kinds of visual data in the CAVE2 such as images, graphs, 360 degree video and WebGL simulation content such as Bio-human anatomy explorer.

2. To simplify the process of developing visual content for the CAVE2, so that lecturers and tutors with basic IT technology expertise can easily set up their own data and use it in tutorials and workshops in the CAVE or in the Collaboration Studio.

It is funded during 2016-2017 by a Commissioned Learning & Teaching grant of $30,000.
