# USC SLICE Project

The SLICE (Student-Led In-CAVE Exploration) project at USC (University of the Sunshine Coast) is aimed at developing new teaching software for our CAVE2 environment (a 320-degree circular CAVE with an 84 mega-pixel display).  The two main goals of the SLICE project are:

1. To improve student engagement by providing tools that allow multiple users to explore and interact with different kinds of visual data in the CAVE2 such as images, graphs, 360 degree video and WebGL simulation content such as Bio-human anatomy explorer.

2. To simplify the process of developing visual content for the CAVE2, so that lecturers and tutors with basic IT technology expertise can easily set up their own data and use it in tutorials and workshops in the CAVE or in the Collaboration Studio.

It is funded during 2016-2017 by a Commissioned Learning & Teaching grant of $30,000.

## Example Outputs

* In 2016 we developed a Powerpoint template for the CAVE, plus best-practice guidelines for how to use Powerpoint in the CAVE.  This template was used by over ten student groups in the MKG221 Sport and Event Marketing course during 2016 Semester 2 to present their case studies in the CAVE.  Here is an [example presentation] (images/20160919_172607_Pano_small.jpg).

* In 2017 we developed an Anatomy App to display the 3D Human models from [BioDigital] (https://biodigital.com) in the CAVE.  It supports timed quizzes, to test student's anatomy knowledge.  The app is built using the SAGE2 (Scalable Amplified Group Environment) environment for large shared displays.  It is the first CAVE app at USC that allows ALL the students in the CAVE to interact with the displayed content simultaneously, by using their mobile phone to control a SAGE2 pointer.  Now that we have learnt how to build SAGE2 apps, we can easily adapt any other interactive web site to work in the CAVE using SAGE2.  Here is an example of several groups of people doing the [quizzes in the CAVE] (images/20170731_anatomy_app.jpg).
